# 4bit-microcontroller
This a 4 bit microcontroller. The components of a typical 4-bit microcontroller are CPU,RAM, Memory, Peripherals and Clock Source. The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the main processing component of the microcontroller. It performs all of the arithmetic and logic operations . The RAM (Random Access Memory) is a small amount of volatile memory used to store data and program instructions . A 4-bit microcontroller typically has a few bytes or a few hundred bytes of RAM. 4-bit microcontrollers may have several peripherals built-in, such as timers, counters, and I/O ports. These peripherals provide additional functionality such as controlling external devices, measuring time, and counting events. A clock source is used to provide a clock signal to the microcontroller, allowing it to synchronize its operations. An internal oscillator or an external crystal can be used as the clock source.The above components work together to provide the functionality required by the application code running on the microcontroller. While a 4-bit microcontroller is not as capable as larger microcontrollers, it can still be useful in simple, low-power applications.We have also built a simple 4 bit microcontroller using the above mentioned components using the AND,OR ,NAND gates , full and half adders and others.The simulation link to the microcontroller is as follows:
